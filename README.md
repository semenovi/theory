# Strange theory
Program checks how much digits contents in all of integers in interval from 0 to `FLOOR_TENS * 10` using [BigInt.h](https://github.com/kasparsklavins/bigint).
##Features
To change integer that you want to count change `const DIGIT` in `main.cpp`.
Program can print all of integers that contents digit that you want to count. To see their, change `const PRINT_INTEGERS`.
To change ceiling of interval of integers, change the value of `const FLOOR_TENS`.
