# Strange theory
Program checks how much digits contents in all of integers in interval from 0 to `FLOOR_TENS * 10` using [BigInt.h](https://github.com/kasparsklavins/bigint).
## Features

All of constant that you can change located in `main.cpp`.

To change integer that you want to count change `const DIGIT`.

Program can print all of integers that contents digit that you want to count. To see their, change `const PRINT_INTEGERS`.

To change ceiling of interval of integers, change the value of `const FLOOR_TENS`.
